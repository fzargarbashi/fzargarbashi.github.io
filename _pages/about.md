**Hi! I'm Fatemeh.**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science jointly at ETH Zurich ([Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/)) and [Disney research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/).
My research lies in bridging the gap between robotics and character animation by investigating how to develop natural motions on legged robots and how to control physics-based animated characters.
I am also interested in developing reinforcement learning algorithms for character control, legged locomotion, and motion generation.

I received my M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, Control from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/), Tehran, Iran.
During my master thesis I worked on the development and control of an over-actuated quadcopter for agile maneuvers.

In my free time, I like cycling, swimming and reading poetry.
I am also an amateur astronomer and I like to go stargazing :telescope: whenever I have the chance.
Recently, I have started exploring night sky photography :camera:!
