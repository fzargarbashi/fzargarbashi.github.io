Hi! I am Fatemeh. I am a joint Ph.D. student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich ([Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/)) and [Disney research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/).
I am interested in bridging the gap between robotics and character animation by investigating how to develop natural motions on legged robots and how to control physics-based animated characters.
I am also interested in developing reinforcement learning algorithms for character control, legged locomotion, and motion generation.

I received my M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, Control from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.
My master thesis was about development and control of an over-actuated quadcopter for agile maneuvers.

During my free time I like cycling, swimming and reading poetry. 
I am also an astronomy fan and I like to go stargazing :telescope: whenever I have the chance.
